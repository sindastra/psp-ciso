# psp-ciso

This repository hosts the original CISO source code by "BOOSTER" (see src/)

This is meant for archival/documentation purposes but you can actually compile and use CISO.

On a Linux system with gcc and zlib installed, just go into ```src/``` and run ```make```.

For a maintained version and releases, please check the repository https://github.com/sindastra/psp-mciso
